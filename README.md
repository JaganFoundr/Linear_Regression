## **📜 Walkthrough**

### 🟢 **One-Dimensional Linear Regression**  
- Implements regression **from scratch** using PyTorch.  
- Fully manual updates of weights and biases to build intuition.  
- Optimizes the model with **gradient descent**.  

🚦 **Key Features**:  
✔ Custom prediction and loss functions.  
✔ Training loop with **1000 epochs** for optimization.  
✔ Clear understanding of how data drives predictions.  

🖥️ **Run it**:  
```bash
python one_dimensional_lr.py
```

---

### 🔵 **Multi-Dimensional Linear Regression**  
- Uses PyTorch’s `nn.Linear` for **seamless parameter management**.  
- Efficient **batch processing** with `DataLoader`.  
- Scales to multiple inputs and outputs.  

🚦 **Key Features**:  
✔ PyTorch modules for abstraction and speed.  
✔ Loss computation using `F.mse_loss`.  
✔ Parameter optimization with **SGD optimizer**.  

🖥️ **Run it**:  
```bash
python multi_dimensional_lr.py
```
